# symphony-rest-tools
Low level tools for use with the Symphony public REST API

Full documentation is available at https://symphonyoss.github.io/symphony-rest-tools/

## Quick Start
Go to the releases page at https://github.com/symphonyoss/symphony-rest-tools/releases and download the latest version of symphony-rest-tools-cmdline-X.Y.Z-bin.tar.gz

This is the pure Java, platform neutral, command line implementation.

Create a directory in a convenient location and extract the tarball:

```
$ mkdir /tmp/srt
$ cd /tmp/srt
$ tar zxf ~/Downloads/symphony-rest-tools-cmdline-0.1.6-bin.tar.gz 
$ ls
bash	bat	certs	lib
```

The **bash** directory contains shell scripts for Unix based systems, the **bat** directory contains Windows batch file scripts which do the same thing for that platform.

The **probePod** command requires a host name and will attempt to discover the configuration of a pod on that host. Launch this script, enter a host name (.symphony.com is applied as a suffix if the entered value has no dots) and hit RETURN to accept the defaults for all other parameters:

```
$ bash/probePod 
Default home area "/Users/bruce/.srt" created.
SRT_HOME set by Default
Press RETURN to accept default values
Enter a space to clear the default value
Leading and trailing whitespace are deleted
Location of SRT home[]: 
Host Name[]: foundation-dev
Keystore File Name[]: 
Keystore Type[pkcs12]: 
Keystore Password[changeit]: 
Truststore File Name[]: 
Truststore Type[jks]: 
Truststore Type[changeit]: 
name=foundation-dev
domain=.symphony.com

The script then attempts to connect to a variety of host name and port number combinations to locate a Symphony Pod:

```
